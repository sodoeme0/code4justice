        <h3> The Stark Foundation, founded by Jynel Kealon, Success Odoemena, Kristine Mlo, and Yonathan Getachew, is a foundation created 
                to lower the rate of poverty in the United States of America, with the dream of extending to the rest of the world.</h3>
                <br>
                <p> Since their establishment in 1945, the Stark Foundation has taken huge steps toward ending the suffering of millions 
                    of Americans less fortunate or not given equal opportunities. Poverty in the early 1950's was at a record high in the 
                    United States, at around 22%. This means roughly 1 of 5 American citizens were poor, thus unable to provide all the 
                    necessary resources for their families. The Stark Foundation had their hand in any major policies implemented to end
                    poverty, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as the food stamp program, the Civil 
                    Rights Act of 1964, the creation of programs like Head Start, Medicare, and Medicaid, as well as Affordable Housing 
                    Programs. As of 2022, we can proudly announce that the new rate of poverty in America is less than 10%.</p>
